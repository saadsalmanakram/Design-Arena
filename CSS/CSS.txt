CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation and layout of a web page. It controls the visual appearance of HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning, by applying styles to them. CSS allows web developers to separate the content of a web page from its design, making it easier to maintain and update the look and feel of a website.
