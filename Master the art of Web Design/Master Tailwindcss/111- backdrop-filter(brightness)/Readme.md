# Backdrop Brightness Utility

## Introduction
The `backdrop-brightness` utility in Tailwind CSS allows you to control the brightness of an element's backdrop. This is useful when applying filters to background elements while maintaining readability and aesthetic effects.

## Usage
The `backdrop-brightness` utility applies a `backdrop-filter: brightness()` style to an element. You can use predefined values, custom properties, or fully custom values to control the brightness of the backdrop.

### Class Naming Convention
| Class | Styles Applied |
|-------|---------------|
| `backdrop-brightness-<number>` | `backdrop-filter: brightness(<number>%);` |
| `backdrop-brightness-(<custom-property>)` | `backdrop-filter: brightness(var(<custom-property>));` |
| `backdrop-brightness-[<value>]` | `backdrop-filter: brightness(<value>);` |

## Examples

### Basic Example
Use predefined brightness values such as `backdrop-brightness-50` and `backdrop-brightness-150`:

```html
<div class="bg-[url(/img/mountains.jpg)]">
  <div class="bg-white/30 backdrop-brightness-50 ..."></div>
</div>
<div class="bg-[url(/img/mountains.jpg)]">
  <div class="bg-white/30 backdrop-brightness-150 ..."></div>
</div>
```

### Using a Custom Value
Set the backdrop brightness using a completely custom value:

```html
<div class="backdrop-brightness-[1.75] ...">
  <!-- Custom brightness applied -->
</div>
```

For CSS variables, use the `backdrop-brightness-(<custom-property>)` syntax:

```html
<div class="backdrop-brightness-(--my-backdrop-brightness) ...">
  <!-- Custom property-based brightness -->
</div>
```
This is a shorthand for `backdrop-brightness-[var(--my-backdrop-brightness)]` that automatically includes the `var()` function.

### Responsive Design
Apply different brightness values at different breakpoints by prefixing the utility with a responsive variant:

```html
<div class="backdrop-brightness-110 md:backdrop-brightness-150 ...">
  <!-- Adjust brightness based on screen size -->
</div>
```

For more details on responsive variants, check the [variants documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).

## Conclusion
The `backdrop-brightness` utility provides a powerful way to control backdrop brightness effects in Tailwind CSS, making it easier to enhance UI designs with filtered backgrounds while keeping elements visually appealing.
