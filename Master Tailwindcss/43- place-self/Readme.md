# place-self Utility in Tailwind CSS

## Introduction
The `place-self` utility in Tailwind CSS allows for precise control over how an individual item is both justified and aligned within a container. This utility is particularly useful when working with CSS Grid layouts, as it enables fine-grained positioning of elements along both the row and column axes simultaneously.

By using `place-self`, you can control alignment behavior on a per-item basis, overriding the `place-items` value set on the grid container. This provides greater flexibility in structuring layouts where individual elements require distinct alignment properties.

## Available Classes
Below is a list of available `place-self` classes and their corresponding styles:

| Class | Style |
|--------|----------------|
| `place-self-auto` | `place-self: auto;` |
| `place-self-start` | `place-self: start;` |
| `place-self-end` | `place-self: end;` |
| `place-self-center` | `place-self: center;` |
| `place-self-stretch` | `place-self: stretch;` |

## Usage Examples

### Auto Alignment
Use `place-self-auto` to allow an item to align based on the container's `place-items` property.

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 ...">
  <div>01</div>
  <div class="place-self-auto ...">02</div>
  <div>03</div>
  <div>04</div>
  <div>05</div>
  <div>06</div>
</div>
```

### Start Alignment
Use `place-self-start` to align an item to the start of both axes.

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 ...">
  <div>01</div>
  <div class="place-self-start ...">02</div>
  <div>03</div>
  <div>04</div>
  <div>05</div>
  <div>06</div>
</div>
```

### Center Alignment
Use `place-self-center` to center an item along both axes.

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 ...">
  <div>01</div>
  <div class="place-self-center ...">02</div>
  <div>03</div>
  <div>04</div>
  <div>05</div>
  <div>06</div>
</div>
```

### End Alignment
Use `place-self-end` to align an item to the end of both axes.

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 ...">
  <div>01</div>
  <div class="place-self-end ...">02</div>
  <div>03</div>
  <div>04</div>
  <div>05</div>
  <div>06</div>
</div>
```

### Stretch Alignment
Use `place-self-stretch` to stretch an item to fill the available space along both axes.

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 ...">
  <div>01</div>
  <div class="place-self-stretch ...">02</div>
  <div>03</div>
  <div>04</div>
  <div>05</div>
  <div>06</div>
</div>
```

## Responsive Design
You can apply `place-self` utilities conditionally using responsive variants. For example, to align an item to the start by default and to the end on medium (`md:`) screens and larger:

```html
<div class="place-self-start md:place-self-end ...">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

For more information on responsive design and variants, refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation.

## Conclusion
The `place-self` utility in Tailwind CSS is a powerful way to individually align grid items along both axes. Whether aligning an item to the start, end, center, or stretching it across available space, `place-self` provides fine-tuned control for building dynamic and flexible layouts. Leveraging responsive design ensures that layouts remain adaptable across different screen sizes.
